# Interest-Theory
All of the problems I have solved in my Mathematical Finance Classes at the University of Texas at Austin.

For Interest Theory at the University of Texas at Austin I was assigned to go through Mathematical Interest Theory by Leslie Jane Federer Vaaler and James W. Daniel. It is quite a coincidence I took Discrete Mathematics with Vaaler. Above are my solutions to the problem sets given out by my instructor Dr. Nibert. Dr. Nibert was a great professor, and helped me learn very much over the weeks during this spring semester. If you are struggling with any of the problems above, then perhaps my explanation of the problem can help you see the mistakes you are making. Whatever purpose this document serves to you. I highly recommend not taking advantage of the solutions related to academic dishonesty. This document is not intended for cheating on homework grades. In fact, you will lose so much fun if you do not allow yourself to find the solution yourself. If you need to contact me for any reason my email is Thomas.Lockwood@utexas.edu.
